My interest in computers began at an early age with the Commodore PET.  Over the years I have enjoyed many computers and operating systems, from the famous Commodore 64 to the Amiga, to the PC, the Mac, running various Unix flavors, Linuxes, BSDs, VMS, Windows, OS X, and more.

Programming was the foundation of my activities, and over the years I have been paid to develop projects in C, C++, shell script, Java, Visual Basic, Python, Ruby, Clojure, and more.

#####Motivation

The promises of improvements in systems - operational improvements, reliability improvement, simplicity improvements, business improvements - have driven my interest in technology and tools.

As an avid reader of technical news sources, I became aware of Bitcoin many years ago.  I watched with curiosity as the business press transitioned from slight curiosity to fear and doubt to what could now be called rabid excitement.

But when I looked for information on Bitcoin and "the blockchain", I found many different explanations of varied quality and accuracy.  This drove me to research more, and soon I began to understand the great potential of blockchain technologies.  (And the full potential is probably yet to be discovered!)

#####Communication and Sharing

In my career I have often found myself discussing and explaining technical topics to non-technical people in business.  This has been very rewarding for me, because I get great satisfaction from helping someone understand a concept that had previously been out of reach.

Now, as I believe that **blockchain technologies can be used for great positive impact on the world** (business and otherwise), I am sharing this enthusiasm and teaching these technical concepts in an accessible way to people of all levels of technical skill.  These concepts can be understood by people who have never touched a computer - it just takes the right approach and the right set of analogies and stories to relate.
