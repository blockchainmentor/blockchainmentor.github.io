###Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt

Bitcoin and its blockchain are new technologies of great promise.  Some practical uses are already apparent, while others remain to be discovered.

Some see a threat, and others see opportunity.  Those who feel threatened sometimes use their power to attempt to influence others in an effort to prevent or postpone the impending change.  The news has been full of articles ranging from euphoric to cataclysmic.  Overly optimistic news may be a source of embarrassment later, but it is less damaging than intentional efforts to spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt.

**Hackers, Criminals, and Scammers**

Fear stories warn of **hackers** stealing bitcoins (implying that your bitcoins will likely be stolen at some point).  They fail to note that hackers already steal a great amount of money out of traditional bank accounts, at the [individual](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/savings/could-bank-hackers-steal-your-money-1.aspx) level as well as - *most incredibly* - at the [central bank](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-13/bangladesh-vows-to-act-against-its-central-bank-over-cyber-heist) level.

Phishing and identity theft are common problems that affect hundreds of people annually even though banking and credit card systems are believed to be well guarded.

Bitcoin has its own unfortunate losses due to hackers, but these apply to the endpoints (individuals and exchanges), not to the system itself.  Following best practices of [wallet](http://www.blockchainmentor.com/whats-in-your-bitcoin-wallet/) safety are as important as managing other assets.

**Criminal** use of bitcoins (and other virtual currencies) is a popular news topic.  But again, this is not a problem unique to bitcoin.  Cash, diamonds, and other forms of currency are far more commonly used for criminal activities than virtual currency.  And since the bitcoin blockchain is public, all transaction are visible.  While the account identities are not known, they can be traced to places where users convert their bitcoins to other currencies.

**Scam** is an unfortunate and popular term thrown around about virtual currencies.  Some people are quick to call bitcoin a scam, either because they don't understand it or because they read about someone losing money to a pyramid scheme that was built on bitcoin.  Once again, the same applies to other forms of currency.  The bitcoin system itself is truly transparent -- its rule system and all transactions are public and open to scrutiny.  The only opportunities for scams are at the human level.  It will be some time before bitcoin achieves the level of scam success of this [65 billion US dollar ponzi](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-bernie-madoffs-ponzi-scheme-worked-2014-7?IR=T).

## The Future

The future of bitcoin, virtual currencies, and blockchain technologies is unclear.  There will be ideas that fail spectacularly; there will be ideas that have modest impact; and there will be a few ideas that become *the thing*.  

There was doubt about the importance and value of the internet in its early days.  Even the champions of the internet probably did not see its full potential.  It's probable that we *still* don't know the full potential.  One thing is clear, however, and that is that the skeptics, contrarians, and naysayers were very wrong.  Visionaries and optimists like [Sergey Brin (Google)](http://uk.businessinsider.com/successful-life-sergey-brin-google-founder-2015-8?r=US&IR=T), [Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook)](http://www.forbes.com/profile/mark-zuckerberg/), [Jeff Bezos (Amazon)](http://fortune.com/amazon-jeff-bezos-prime/), [Reed Hastings (Netflix)](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/03/26/inside-netflix-how-reed-hastings-is-building-the-first-global-tv/),  are the new leaders of the business world.

Who will be the next generation of leaders?
