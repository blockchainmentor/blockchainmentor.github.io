##Goal
Allow one party to send electronic cash to another safely, without requiring a trusted third party.

##How Achieved?
A large number of independent computers process and validate transactions.  Each computer runs a program that validates transactions, records transaction histories, and performs extra calculations that put such a time/effort cost into writing transactions that it is practically impossible to change history (preventing fraud).

##What Motivates Participants?
Those who participate by providing computing resources for transaction validation (called [*miners*](http://www.blockchainmentor.com/how-are-transactions-processed-mining/)) are not being generous, they are working to gain a share of the rewards designed into the system for transaction processors.  These rewards include a fixed amount for successfully competing a block of transactions plus all the transaction fees included in each of the transactions being written.

##Why Bother?
This system provides some immediate benefits compared to traditional payment systems:

* reasonably fast transaction processing (approx. 10 minutes, compared to 1-2 days for bank to bank)
* any time, any where - the system runs on "internet time", so it's open 24/7 and reaches anywhere the internet does
* no central authority, so one's account cannot be frozen, seized, or transferred without the owner's involvement (barring [theft](http://www.blockchainmentor.com/whats-in-your-bitcoin-wallet/), etc.)
* low transaction fees, where the typical fee is much less than 0.001 BTC (approx. $0.50)
* resilience against attack, failure, and outage since the network is made up of many computers spread around the world and not belonging to a single company
