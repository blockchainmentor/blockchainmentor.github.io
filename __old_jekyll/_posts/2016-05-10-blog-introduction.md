## Exciting Times

New technologies are being developed and tested today which will radically reshape the future of how business and finance works.  The blockchain concept and its associated virtual currencies will be driving this change.  

Those who understand these new technologies will be positioned to become tomorrow's industry leaders - the next Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple.

## Join Us

The Blockchain Mentor blog will provide introductory and educational posts and news about virtual currencies and the blockchain technologies that underpin these virtual currencies, as well as the ecosystems forming around them.

As a means of understanding these new and complicated topics, some oversimplifications will be made initially; these concepts will later be explained in increasing detail until complete and *technically* correct.

Bitcoin will be the blockchain technology we focus on initially, but the concepts will often apply to other (future) blockchain technologies.  Additionally, we will explore some of these newer/alternative blockchains.
