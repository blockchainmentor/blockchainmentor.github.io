## What Is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a virtual (crypto) currency - a form of electronic cash. 

Bitcoin is the most well known, highly valued, and actively traded cryptocurrency in active existence today; and as of this writing there are more than 15 million bitcoins in circulation. The USD value of a bitcoin (*BTC*) is currently about $695 [^n], which gives a market capitalization of about $11 billion. Daily transaction volumes vary, but recently have been in the $40-$60 million range.

## Where do bitcoins come from?

Bitcoins are created through a process called *mining*.  Bitcoins are created as a side effect of bitcoin transaction processing.  Many computers (called *nodes*) scattered around the internet make up the Bitcoin network.  Those computers run programs that process bitcoin transactions following an exact set of rules.  When one of those computers processes transactions and records them in the permanent record, that computer is rewarded with the creation of a new number of bitcoins.  The exact number of new bitcoins created depends on the rules of the system, but currently that number is 25 BTC.

## How are bitcoins exchanged between parties?

Bitcoins are stored in wallets.  Wallets are typically electronic files, but they can be printed and stored on some physical medium (like paper).

Bitcoins are exchanged when one person (using software, such as a bitcoin wallet program) announces to the bitcoin network that they wish to transfer some number of coins to another bitcoin wallet.  This announcement involves special cryptographic security as specified by the bitcoin system rules; the users involved in the transaction don't have to do anything special beyond providing a password to access their wallet.

The nodes on the bitcoin network that process transactions become aware of this new transaction request, and they do calculations and validations on the request.  If it passes (and the transaction is deemed valid), then it becomes permanent and the receiving party then officially possesses the transferred coins.  By design of the bitcoin system, it takes an average of about 10 minutes for a transaction to be validated and completed.

## What prevents counterfeiting and fraud?

The bitcoin system records all completed and validated transactions in the public ledger called *blockchain*. Part of the transaction processing that the nodes perform involves checking against this blockchain to ensure that the coins being transferred actually belong to the sender.

Likewise, the nodes ensure that new bitcoins can only be created following the guidelines of the bitcoin system.  This prevents users from simply creating their own (counterfeit) coins.

This explanation conveniently skips the details related to *proof of work* and consensus, but suffice to say that these mechanisms make it infeasible for anyone to create invalid transactions or alter historical transactions.  Details on these features will be explored in later posts.

## How safe are bitcoins?

A Bitcoin, as with most modern currencies, is not tied to commodities and thus has no intrinsic value. The value of a bitcoin is based on complex factors including the ease and reliability of exchange (for goods and services or for other currencies), the public sentiment, the availability of supply, the security of the system, etc.

Concerns about the safety of bitcoin usually relate to the stability and security of the system by which bitcoin is defined and processed.  This system was designed with cryptographic and logical rules that make it practically impossible to cause fake, false, or invalid transactions to get added to the permanent blockchain.  As it is currently understood by the computer science and other academic communities, the Bitcoin system cannot be hacked.  There have been some instances where software bugs caused disruptions in the system, but those were resolved in short enough time that faith in the system was apparently maintained.

Since the bitcoin network is decentralized, no government or company controls it.  This, in theory, can provide stability beyond what fiat currencies enjoy.  Of course, periods of shifting sentiment, currency exchanges, and other events can cause sometimes dramatic changes in bitcoin price relative to other currencies; however, the same can be true for fiat to fiat exchanges.

## The Big News

The big news, and what really sets bitcoin apart from previous attempts at electronic cash, is that it is maintained by a large decentralized consensus of computers spread around the internet.  Once set in motion, the system cannot be changed without all of the participating nodes agreeing on the change.  Thus, it is much less susceptible to takeover or manipulation than other systems (electronic or fiat).

This decentralized consensus system and the public blockchain that store the data will be explored in much greater detail in future posts.

Further, we will explore the many possibilities (real and imagined) for how these systems can be used beyond just sending and receiving coins.
